Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n\n# A.) Primary Business issue\n\nIn order to explore the restaurant information. We will have the need to use some information about the Localities in New York City And Toronto. We must be sure that the place where the restaurant joint is opened will have enough customers and also that there aren't a large amount of restaurant joints in the place. For this reason, we need to analyze different scenarios in the area to make sure that the restaurant will be successful in the area. We are going to try to avoid others restaurant Joint in the area and we are looking for a area where there are:\n\n1.) different district school information\n2.) restaurant information\n3.)For this project we are mainly concerned with the area around two cities to setup a restaurant Joint to ensure maximum profitability for new business."

And we are going to work with this type of maps to identify our venues locations:\n\nFrom Foursquare we will need the following venues data:\n\nschool information\nrestaurant information that we will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the restaurant joint."
